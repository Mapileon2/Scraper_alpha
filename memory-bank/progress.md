# Progress: AI-Powered Web Scraper

**What Works:**

*   Created the memory-bank directory and core files.
*   Populated the core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md) with information from the PRD.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Set up the basic project structure (app.py, config.py, src/, models/, requirements.txt, .env).
*   Implement the Streamlit UI with input fields for API key, URL, CSS selector, max pages, instructions, and a scrape button.
*   Implement the Crawl4AI scraping logic.
*   Implement the Pydantic-AI with Gemini LLM data processing logic.
*   Implement the file generation logic (Excel and Markdown).
*   Implement error handling and input validation.
*   Test the application with YellowPages and other websites.
*   Document the code and prepare the README.

**Current Status:**

*   Project setup and documentation initialization are complete.
*   Ready to start implementing the core functionality.

**Known Issues:**

*   None at this time.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   The initial plan is to follow the PRD closely and implement the MVP functionality first.
*   Future enhancements, such as vector server integration, will be considered in a later phase.
